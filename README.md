A text formatting app for WhatsApp messages
Heyy what's good, or should I say, WhatsApp?? Haha very funny ok now use my app bye. Ok so basically, you know when you copyaste a bunch of whatsapp messages they're all annoyingly formatted with name and date and time in them, well you can just paste them in the line below, and using a regural expression carefully created, designed, tested and uhh marketing adjectives, by yours truly, all your wanted messages will be displayed in the paragrph below, ready for you to copypaste to yo relatives, so what are you waiting for?
